    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Urban safety remains a fundamental concern for cities worldwide, with crime posing persistent challenges to social stability and quality of life. According to a set of Office for Natinal Statistics (ONS) crime data covering the 12 months up to September 2024, London -as the capital of UK- has one of the lowest rates of violent crime and violent crime with injury but also the highest overall rate of crime per 1,000 people in its population. A main contributor for this situation is the high volume of various theft crime.(Hill, 2025) \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in order to better protect citizens' property, it is essential to identify and predict when and where theft crimes are most likely to occur across different parts of London.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reseach focuses on finding a machine learning model that performs better in predicting theft risk across London. With open data provided by Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and ONS, this research seeks to uncover key socioeconomic elements that influence high-risk area distributions.\n",

    "## Literature review\n",
    "\n",
    "Crime has been a key topic in the statistical, social, and spatial analysis reseach. Since the mid-20th century, various social and environmental factors have been found to influence crime rates. Routine Activity Theory identifies three fundamental conditions necessary for a crime to occur: a motivated offender, a suitable target, and the absence of a capable guardian (Cohen and Felson, 1979). Subsequent studies have expanded on this by examining links between crime and broader socio-economic factors using traditional logistic regression models, such as inequality and unemployment (Hojman, 2004).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent reviews (Yin, 2022; Mandalapu et al., 2023) highlight the great potential of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in crime prediction, emphasizing their ability to capture complex patterns and improve forecasting accuracy across diverse urban contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Yunus and Loo (2024) compared several regression-based models for predicting street-level crime in London and found that XGBoost significantly outperformed traditional linear models, with a higher RÂ² score and lower prediction errors. Similarly, Yue and Chen (2025) applied XGBoost combined with SHAP to predict crime rate, showing that the proportion of non-local residents and age group contribute the most to crime prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing studies have emphasized the predictive power of ML models, few have provided the interpretable prediction results. This research seeks to combine predictive modelling with SHAP-based interpretation and spatial analysis to identify key socio-economic drivers of theft in London.\n",
