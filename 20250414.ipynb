    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Urban safety remains a fundamental concern for cities worldwide, with crime posing persistent challenges to social stability and quality of life. According to a set of Office for Natinal Statistics (ONS) crime data covering the 12 months up to September 2024, London -as the capital of UK- has one of the lowest rates of violent crime and violent crime with injury but also the highest overall rate of crime per 1,000 people in its population. A main contributor for this situation is the high volume of various theft crime.(Hill, 2025) \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in order to better protect citizens' property, it is essential to identify and predict when and where theft crimes are most likely to occur across different parts of London.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reseach focuses on finding a machine learning model that performs better in predicting theft risk across London. With open data provided by Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and ONS, this research seeks to uncover key socioeconomic elements that influence high-risk area distributions.\n",

    "## Literature review\n",
    "\n",
    "Crime has been a key topic in reseach，many have proved that it's not randomly distributed, but shaped by underlying socio-economic conditions and spatial processes. Classical theories like Routine Activity Theory (Cohen and Felson, 1979) have long guided statistical modelling of crime, often through logic regression models linking crime rates to elements like population, housing, educaation and deprivation (Glasson and Cozens, 2011; Hojman, 2004).\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) offered a more effective way to predicting crime. Models like XGBoost and random forest can capture non-linear and high-dimensional relationships, usually outperforming traditional models in terms of predictive power (Yin, 2022; Yunus and Loo, 2024). Despite their accuracy, these \"black-box\" models have been criticized for lacking interpretability—making them difficult to apply in policy-making and urban governance (Mandalapu et al., 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, Yue and Chen (2025) applied XGBoost combined with SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) to predict crime rate, showing that the proportion of non-local residents and age group contribute the most to crime prediction. Yet, it didn't offer findings in spatial inequality.\n",

    "## Research questions\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the former researches, this study focusing on the theft in London, aims to investigate how interpretable ML can help to identify and explain the key socio-economic and spatial drivers of crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this goal, the study is divided into two research  questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compared to traditional statistical methods, do machine learning models significantly improve the accuracy of predicting the risk of theft across different areas of London?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which socio-economic factors most strongly influence the risk of theft and how can we interpret their contributions in different areas of London?\n",
